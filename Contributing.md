# Contributing
Hi, and thanks for considering contributing! Before you do though, here's a few
notes on how best to contribute.

## Pull Request Process
Changes are proposed in the form of pull requests against `master` by you, the contributor!

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the standard laid out in the git manual; that is,
a one-line summary ()

	Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

	More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
	characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
	subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
	line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
	the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
	two together.



## Develolpment Workflow

New features and bug fixes are developed in branches, and merged to `develop` for testing.

Tested features are merged into `master`. Pull requests should be made against `master`
